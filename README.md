## Installation

NOTE: For the AI functionality, you need to add a MistralAI API Key which you need to use either as environment variable or save it in a file named `secrets.txt`

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Modern web browser with WebSocket support

### Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install aiohttp
pip install python-socketio
pip install aiohttp-session
pip install bidict
pip install mistralai
pip install openai
pip install websockets
```

### Configuration

1. Set up your AI API keys in `secrets.txt` for the adventure system
2. Configure authentication settings in `auth.py`
3. Initialize the databases by running the server (they'll be created automatically)

## Usage

### Starting the Server

Run the main server:

```bash
python server.py
```

The server will start on the default port and initialize all necessary databases.

### Accessing the Platform

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the server address
2. Register a new account or log in with existing credentials
3. Choose from various activities:
   - Join chat rooms and conversations
   - Play single-player retro games
   - Start or join multiplayer games
   - Begin AI-powered text adventures
   - Join voice chat rooms

### Command Line Client

For testing or automation, use the command-line client:

```bash
python client.py
```
